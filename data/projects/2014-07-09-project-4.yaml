description: Market research is expensive, uninformative and disruptive for customers. It is also obsolete in the digital age. We enable instant psychological assessment of your users based on their online behaviour generating feedback on potential areas for expansion. If your competitor is successfully engaging one psychodemographic segment of the market (e.g. sporty energy drinks), perhaps it would be worth designing a product for those who are left out (e.g. energy drinks for library owls).
